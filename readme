# Project Gutenberg Fiction Scraper

This project is a simple web scraper designed to extract information about fiction books available on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org). The scraper retrieves data such as book titles, authors, and links to their respective pages, and saves the data in a CSV file for further use.

## Features
- Extracts book titles, authors, and links from the Project Gutenberg fiction search page.
- Saves the extracted data in a CSV file (`gutenberg_books.csv`).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data extraction and processing.
- **Requests**: To fetch HTML content from the website.
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)**: For parsing and navigating the HTML content.
- **Pandas**: For storing and saving the data in a structured format.

## How It Works

1. The script sends an HTTP GET request to the Project Gutenberg search page for fiction books.
2. The HTML content of the page is parsed using `BeautifulSoup`.
3. The script locates elements containing book information and extracts:
   - **Title**: The book's title.
   - **Author**: The book's author (if available).
   - **Link**: The URL to the book's page on Project Gutenberg.
4. The extracted data is saved in a CSV file named `gutenberg_books.csv`.

## Output

The output is a CSV file containing the following columns:
- `Title`: The title of the book.
- `Author`: The author of the book (or "Unknown" if not available).
- `Link`: A direct link to the book's page on Project Gutenberg.

## Example

Here is a snippet of the resulting CSV:

| Title               | Author             | Link                                      |
